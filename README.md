> 7+ years shipping production systems end-to-end. I build SaaS platforms solo at the speed of a team — AI-native workflows with senior-level validation. ~960 commits across 22 repos in the last 7 months.

## What I'm Building

### 🚢 Production SaaS Platforms

- 🎙️ **MASS Lead Connect** — Multi-tenant AI voice receptionist SaaS. Three Next.js apps, SST v3 on AWS, DynamoDB, Cognito, Telnyx voice, Stripe billing, WebRTC browser calling, and an autonomous agent runtime with human-in-the-loop approvals *(523 commits)*
- 🎰 **[Beat The Odds](https://github.com/Beat-The-Odds-LLC)** — Real-time fantasy sports platform with web + kiosk experiences, merchandise rewards, responsible gambling handlers, Stripe payments, and admin dashboards *(100+ commits)*
- ⛵ **yachttransport.ai** — Built an end-to-end quoting and booking platform for global yacht shipping. Role-based dashboards, booking workflows, and Postgres-backed pricing logic. Started with a voice AI MVP demo (Vapi conversational booking) that landed the full contract
- 🏔️ **Milestorm.io** — Designed and launched a supply-chain niche project management app into private beta. Multi-tenant auth, milestone tracking, and reporting views
- 🎓 **[Home Team Education](https://hometeameducation.org/)** — 501(c)(3) nonprofit building an AI-powered animated money mentor that teaches teens financial literacy. Next.js, AI coach, interactive quizzes, donation flows
- 🕌 **Mecca Gateway** — Full-stack platform with SST v3, Cognito branded auth, 22 React Email templates, RBAC, investor dashboard *(74 commits)*

### 🛠️ Developer Tools & Open Source

- 🗣️ **[blah3](https://github.com/Anomali007/blah3)** — Native macOS desktop app for 100% offline Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech on Apple Silicon. Built in Rust with Tauri, CoreML-accelerated Whisper models, floating dictation overlay, DMG packaging
- 🔀 **[MergeReel](https://github.com/the-mass-lab)** — GitHub app that generates video summaries of Pull Requests using Remotion. Stripe billing, org-level repo fetching
- 🔧 **tml-cli** — Custom org CLI with security hardening, multi-user profile access control, and provisioning commands
- 📊 **[git-tracker](https://github.com/Anomali007/git-tracker)** — GitHub Activity Dashboard — tracks commits, PRs, issues, and language stats across repos
- 🔐 **[THE Wallet](https://github.com/the-mass-lab)** — Modular data sovereignty platform with plugin architecture, encryption, and RBAC *(early stage)*

### 🌐 Client / Freelance

- 🦷 **AI Voice Receptionist** — Vapi + LLM orchestration for inbound calls → reduced live call handling ~50%, increased bookings ~30%
- 🛒 **MNG Store** — E-commerce with Next.js + Snipcart, Printful integration
- 🚗 Various business sites shipped in days, not weeks — AI turned client work into a cash-flow engine

## AI-Native Developer Platform

I built a full Claude Code developer platform that turns a solo operation into something with the quality controls of a team:

- **`/ship`** — One command: changed files → tests → lint → code-reviewer agent (security, multi-tenant isolation, performance) → fix → commit → push → structured PR
- **Safety hooks** — `pre_bash_guard.py` blocks dangerous commands, `post_write_secret_scan.py` catches leaked keys/tokens, auto-formatting on every write
- **11 custom slash commands**, 6 specialized agents, 4 safety hooks — portable across all repos

## What I'm Doing

- **Shipping at AI speed** — Building and deploying full SaaS platforms solo, from infrastructure to frontend to billing
- **Fractional CTO work** — Architecture, delivery, quality gates, and team enablement for client products
- **Studying cybersecurity** — B.S. Cybersecurity & Information Assurance at WGU
- **Exploring Rust** — Built blah3 with zero prior Rust experience; AI gave me the confidence to ship a native desktop app in days

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, Next.js (App Router & Pages), React Native/Expo, Tailwind CSS \
**Backend:** Node.js, tRPC, REST/GraphQL, Python, FastAPI, Serverless \
**Cloud/DevOps:** AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, RDS, S3, Cognito, SES), SST v3, Vercel, GitHub Actions, Docker \
**Data:** PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, Prisma/Drizzle ORM \
**AI/Automation:** Claude Code, Cursor, OpenAI APIs, Vapi, ElevenLabs, Deepgram \
**Security:** OAuth2/OIDC, RBAC, secrets management, threat-aware design, CI quality gates

### Philosophy

> "Ship beats perfect" — I use AI to move at ludicrous speed, but every line gets senior-level review. Tests, types, security passes, and CI gates are non-negotiable.
