The site is live. No fanfare, no launch countdown — just shipped it.

I'm Mali. I build production software, usually solo, usually fast. Over the last seven months I've pushed 960+ commits across 22 repos — SaaS platforms, developer tools, desktop apps, voice AI systems. Most of it powered by an AI-native workflow I've been refining since early 2023.

This site is where I'll write about that process. Expect posts on:

- **AI-assisted development workflows** — how I actually use Claude Code, what the `/ship` pipeline looks like, and where AI falls short
- **Project breakdowns** — architecture decisions, trade-offs, and the unglamorous parts of shipping solo
- **Lessons from building** — things that worked, things that didn't, and what I'd do differently

No hot takes, no thought leadership, no "10x developer" nonsense. Just notes from someone building real things at an unusual pace.

More soon.
